# Requirements for Python 3.14 (WITHOUT Deep Learning)
# This installs ML models only - you'll still get 4 working models!

# Core Data Science Libraries
pandas>=2.2.0
numpy>=1.26.0
matplotlib>=3.8.0
seaborn>=0.13.0

# Machine Learning (These work perfectly!)
scikit-learn>=1.4.0
imbalanced-learn>=0.12.0

# Natural Language Processing
nltk>=3.8.1
gensim>=4.3.2
wordcloud>=1.9.3

# Web Application
streamlit>=1.31.0

# Utilities
joblib>=1.3.2
plotly>=5.18.0
regex>=2023.12.25
h5py>=3.10.0
setuptools>=69.0.0

# Note: TensorFlow doesn't support Python 3.14 yet
# You'll have 4 ML models: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest
# These are very powerful and often perform as well as deep learning!
